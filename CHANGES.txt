BIG TODO: add tests for lovely.recipe.zeo and lovely.recipe.zope to test and
          to show for what this all is for.

- using extras_require to filter dependencies installed by setuptools
  on recipe level.
  
  The following extras install dependencies for the following entry points:
  
  * [i18n]: i18n = lovely.recipe.i18n.i18n:I18n
  * [zope]: instance = lovely.recipe.zope.zope:LovelyInstance
            app = lovely.recipe.zope.zope:LovelyApp
  * [zeo]:  server = lovely.recipe.zeo:LovelyServer

  Dependencies for all the other recipes are installed by default.
  
  To use this branch you need to change your setup.py to use this
  specific spelling:
  
  install_requires = ['lovely.recipe[<extra>]', ...]
